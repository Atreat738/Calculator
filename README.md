*Under Construction*
Desktop Calculator Project!

This calculator will take 2 numbers and an operator to make an equation. 
To Use: Enter the desired equation by clicking the number/operator buttons and press enter to see the result.
Clear or Delete any numbers entered in by mistake!

Sidenote: This calculator does not make use of the eval() method. 
Eval(), while convenient, has some security risks associated with it.
Additionally: The hard way is more fun! >;)
